  abstract = {Recently automatic categorization of Electrocardiogram (ECG) has garnered great attention as it is the most reliable measure for monitoring cardiovascular system functionality. Deep learning has been proven to be a very efficient and accurate approach in this field. A deep learning method based on twodimensional deep convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper for classifying heartbeats in order to accurately detect five different arrhythmias in accordance with the AAMI EC57 standard. Its performance is compared with another method based on one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network by using PhysioNet's MIT-BIH dataset for evaluation. Both of these CNN methods proved to be better than some state of the art methods when implemented on the same dataset. The 2D CNN method outperformed all the other implemented methods with an average accuracy of 94.37\%.},

  abstract = {Objective: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequent and routine diagnostic tool used for monitoring heart electrical signals and evaluating its functionality. The human heart can suffer from a variety of diseases, including cardiac arrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rhythm that in severe cases can lead to heart stroke and can be diagnosed via ECG recordings. Since early detection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and automated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals have received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper introduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8 different cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning method, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG signals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The rhythm classification was done by an 11layer network in an end-to-end manner without the need for hand-crafted manual feature extraction. Results: In order to evaluate the proposed technique, ECG signals are chosen from the two physionet databases, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the long-term AF database. The proposed deep learning framework based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) showed promising results than most of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reaches the mean diagnostic accuracy of 98.24\%. Conclusion: A trained model for arrhythmia classification using diverse ECG signals were successfully developed and tested. Significance: Since the present work uses a light classification technique with high diagnostic accuracy compared to other notable methods, it could successfully be implemented in holter monitor devices for arrhythmia detection.},

  abstract = {Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) causes significant global mortality. The recent development in artificial intelligence shows the feasibility of early non-invasive screening of several lifethreatening cardiovascular diseases. However, such approaches have been less prolific in diagnosis of CAD due to lack of clinically known definite bio-marker. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that effectively combines two non-specific CAD markers, 1) anomalous morphology of Electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform and 2) abnormal Heart Rate Variability (HRV). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure is defined for extraction of morphological ECG features. Another composite structure is defined based on Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) and a set of hand crafted statistical features for measuring the extent of HRV. The two independent bio-markers are subsequently combined in a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for classification of CAD. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets, a corpus, selected from the MIMIC II waveform dataset and a partially noisy in-house dataset, recorded using a low-cost ECG sensor. Results show that overall classification accuracy of 93\% and 88\% are achieved on the two datasets, which outperform the existing approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Valvular heart disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and remains underdiagnosed. Deep learning analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) may be useful in detecting aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), and mitral regurgitation (MR). OBJECTIVES This study aimed to develop ECG deep learning algorithms to identify moderate or severe AS, AR, and MR alone and in combination. METHODS A total of 77,163 patients undergoing ECG within 1 year before echocardiography from 2005-2021 were identified and split into train (n ¼ 43,165), validation (n ¼ 12,950), and test sets (n ¼ 21,048; 7.8\% with any of AS, AR, or MR). Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AU-ROC) and precisionrecall curves. Outside validation was conducted on an independent data set. Test accuracy was modeled using different disease prevalence levels to simulate screening efficacy using the deep learning model. RESULTS The deep learning algorithm model accuracy was as follows: AS (AU-ROC: 0.88), AR (AU-ROC: 0.77), MR (AUROC: 0.83), and any of AS, AR, or MR (AU-ROC: 0.84; sensitivity 78\%, specificity 73\%) with similar accuracy in external validation. In screening program modeling, test characteristics were dependent on underlying prevalence and selected sensitivity levels. At a prevalence of 7.8\%, the positive and negative predictive values were 20\% and 97.6\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Deep learning analysis of the ECG can accurately detect AS, AR, and MR in this multicenter cohort and may serve as the basis for the development of a valvular heart disease screening program.

  abstract = {An automatic system for heart arrhythmia classification can perform a substantial role in managing and treating cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a deep learning-based multi-model system is proposed for the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Two different deep learning bagging models are introduced to classify heartbeats into different arrhythmias types. The first model (CNN-LSTM) is based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture local features and temporal dynamics in the ECG data. The second model (RRHOS-LSTM) integrates some classical features, i.e. RR intervals and higher-order statistics (HOS), with LSTM model to effectively highlight abnormality heartbeats classes. We create a bagging model from the CNN-LSTM and RRHOS-LSTM networks by training each model on a different sub-sampling dataset to handle the high imbalance distribution of arrhythmias classes in the ECG data. Each model is also trained using a weighted loss function to provide high weight for not sufficiently represented classes. These models are then combined using a meta-classifier to form a strong coherent model. The meta-classifier is a feedforward fully connected neural network that takes the different predictions of bagging models as an input and combines them into a final prediction. The result of the meta-classifier is then verified by another CNN-LSTM model to decrease the false positive of the overall system. The experimental results are acquired by evaluating the proposed method on ECG data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 95.81\% in the ‘‘subject-oriented’’ patient independent evaluation scheme. The averages of F1 score and positive predictive value are higher than all other methods by more than 3\% and 8\% respectively. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method for ECG heartbeats classification compared to many state-of-the-art methods.},

Understanding the characteristics that make a good representation remains a topic of ongoing research.

However, focusing solely on representations that adhere to the stringent requirements of most disentanglement metrics, may result in overlooking many high-quality representations, well suited for various downstream tasks. These metrics often demand that generative factors be encoded in distinct, single dimensions aligned with the canonical basis of the representation space.},

The LSTM-based AE network (LSTM-AE) is used to learn the features from ECG arrhythmias signals, and the SVM is used to classify those signals from the learned features. The LSTM-AE consists of an encoder model, which extracts high-level feature information from ECG arrhythmias signals through LSTM network, and a decoder model which outputs reconstruct ECG arrhythmias signals from high-level features through LSTM network. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn better features than the traditional method without any prior knowledge, presenting a good potential for the ECG arrhythmias classification. In the classification of five heartbeats types, including normal, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature complexes (APC), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), the proposed method achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.74\%, 99.35\%, and 99.84\%, respectively, in the beat-based cross-validation approach, and 85.20\%, 62.99\%, and 90.75\%, respectively, in the record-based cross-validation approach, in public MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

  abstract = {In humans, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) refers to the chronic progressive condition that drastically influences the pumping potentiality of the heart muscle. This CHF has the possibility of increasing health expenditure, morbidity, mortality and minimized quality of life. In this context, Electrocardiogram (ECG) is considered as the simplest and a non-invasive diagnosis method that aids in detecting and demonstrating the realizable changes in CHF. However, diagnosing CHF based on manual exploration of ECG signals is frequently impacted by errors as duration and small amplitude of the signals either investigated separately or in the integration is determined to neither specific nor sensitive. At this juncture, the reliability and diagnostic objectivity of ECG signals during the CHF detection process may be enhanced through the inclusion of automated computer-aided system. In this paper, Deep CNN and LSTM Architecture (DCNN-LSTM)-based automated diagnosis system is proposed for detecting CHF using ECG signals. In specific, CNN is included for the purpose of extracting deep features and LSTM is used for attaining the objective of CHF detection using the extracted features. This proposed DCNN-LSTM is evolved with minimal preprocessing of ECG signals and does not involve any classification process or manual engineered features during diagnosis. The experimentation of the proposed DCNN-LSTM conducted using the real time ECG signals datasets confirmed an accuracy of 99.52, sensitivity of 99.31\%, specificity of 99.28\%, F-Score of 98.94\% and AUC of 99.9\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The improved diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) from electrocardiograms (ECG) may help prevent their severity. Since Deep Learning (DL) became popular, several DL methods have been developed for ECG classification. In this work, we compare how different methods for ECG signal representation perform in the multi-label classification of CVDs, including recent attention-based strategies. Furthermore, multimodal fusion strategies are employed to improve the prediction capacity of individual representation networks. The publicly available PTB-XL ECG dataset, which contains 21,837 records and labels for the diagnosis of 4 CVDs, was used for the task. Two DL strategies using different processing approaches were compared. Recurrent Neural Network-based models take advantage of the temporal dependence between raw signal values, namely through Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 1D-Convolutional Neural Network models. Additionally, the raw ECG was converted into image representations, based on recent work, and the classification was performed using distinct 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks. The potential of multimodal DL was then studied through early, late and joint data fusion strategies, to evaluate the benefit of resorting to multiple representations. Results based on the 1D ECG representation outperform image-based approaches and multimodal models. The best model, GRU, achieved sensitivity and specificity of 79.67\% and 81.04\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Arrhythmia is a cardiac conduction disorder characterized by irregular heartbeats. Abnormalities in the conduction system can manifest in the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. However, it can be challenging and timeconsuming to visually assess the ECG signals due to the very low amplitudes. Implementing an automated system in the clinical setting can potentially help expedite diagnosis of arrhythmia, and improve the accuracies. In this paper, we propose an automated system using a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature beats (APB) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) on ECG signals. The novelty of this work is that we used ECG segments of variable length from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia physio bank database. The proposed system demonstrated high classification performance in the handling of variablelength data, achieving an accuracy of 98.10\%, sensitivity of 97.50\% and specificity of 98.70\% using ten-fold cross validation strategy. Our proposed model can aid clinicians to detect common arrhythmias accurately on routine screening ECG.},

  abstract = {Automatic and accurate prognosis of myocardial infarction (MI) using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task for the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. MI is also referred as a “Heart Attack”, which is the most fatal cardiovascular disease. In many cases, MI does not show any symptoms, hence it is also called a “silent heart attack”. In such cases, patients do not get time to prepare themselves. Hence this disease is more dangerous and fatal with a high mortality rate. Hence, we have proposed an automated detection system of MI using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by a convolutional neural network (CNN), hybrid CNN- long short-term memory network (LSTM), and ensemble technique to choose the optimum performing model. In this work, we have used 123,998 ECG beats obtained from the “PTB diagnostic database (PTBDB)” and “MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) to develop the model. The experiment is performed in two stages: (i) using original and unbalanced datasets and (ii) using a balanced dataset, obtained from synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) data sampling technique. We have obtained the highest classification accuracy of 99.82 \%, 99.88 \%, and 99.89 \% using CNN, hybrid CNN-LSTM, and ensemble techniques, respectively. Hence the proposed novel data balancing technique (SMOTE-Tomek Link) not only solves the imbalanced data problem but also increases the minority class accuracy significantly. Now our developed model is ready for the clinical application that can be installed in hospitals for the detection of MI.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe role of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in clinical practice is limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80\% and specificity over 99\%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.},

  abstract = {During the lockdown of universities and the COVID-Pandemic most students were restricted to their homes. Novel and instigating teaching methods were required to improve the learning experience and so recent implementations of the annual PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenges posed as a reference. For over 20 years, the challenges have proven repeatedly to be of immense educational value, besides leading to technological advances for specific problems. In this paper, we report results from the class ‘Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Challenge’, which was implemented as an online project seminar at Technical University Darmstadt, Germany, and which was heavily inspired by the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 ‘AF Classification from a Short Single Lead ECG Recording’. Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac disease and often remains undetected. Therefore, we selected the two most promising models of the course and give an insight into the Transformerbased DualNet architecture as well as into the CNN-LSTM-based model and finally a detailed analysis for both. In particular, we show the model performance results of our internal scoring process for all submitted models and the near state-of-the-art model performance for the two named models on the official 2017 challenge test set. Several teams were able to achieve F1 scores above/close to 90\% on a hidden test-set of Holter recordings. We highlight themes commonly observed among participants, and report the results from the self-assessed student evaluation. Finally, the self-assessment of the students reported a notable increase in machine learning knowledge.},

The main field of work in this area is classification, which is increasingly supported by machine learning-based algorithms. In this work, a deep neural network was developed for the automatic classification of primary ECG signals. The research was carried out on the data contained in a PTB-XL database. Three neural network architectures were proposed: the first based on the convolutional network, the second on SincNet, and the third on the convolutional network, but with additional entropy-based features. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets in proportions of 70\%, 15\%, and 15\%, respectively. The studies were conducted for 2, 5, and 20 classes of disease entities. The convolutional network with entropy features obtained the best classification result. The convolutional network without entropy-based features obtained a slightly less successful result, but had the highest computational efficiency, due to the significantly lower number of neurons.},

  abstract = {This work intends to predict heart disease utilizing data from an ElectroCardioGram by means of a Convolutional Neural Network. Important information about the state of the heart is provided by ECG signals; anomalies often point to the underlying causes of cardiovascular disorders. Conventions in conventional ECG analysis were based on subjective manual interpretation, which was time-consuming. Conversely, CNNs can learn features themselves from raw data; consequently, this could be a possibly practical approach towards efficiency and effectiveness in diagnosis. Therefore, our work focusses on building and optimising a trained CNN model for a large annotated ECG signal dataset. In pattern identification of several cardiac diseases, including but not limited to arrhythmias, ischaemia, and myocardial infarctions, extensive experimentation and validation of the suggested model show its superiority to alternative models. Average obtained accuracy is 77.89\%. These results show that by means of early detection and risk stratification of heart illness, CNN-based approaches show potential in further improving clinical decision support systems and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a very common, non-invasive diagnostic procedure and its interpretation is increasingly supported by algorithms. The progress in the field of automatic ECG analysis has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first benchmarking results for the recently published, freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG dataset PTB-XL, covering a variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks to age and sex prediction. Among the investigated deep-learning-based timeseries classification algorithms, we find that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance across all tasks. We find consistent results on the ICBEB2018 challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. These benchmarking results are complemented by deeper insights into the classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis, which provide connecting points for future research on the dataset. Our results emphasize the prospects of deep-learning-based algorithms in the field of ECG analysis, not only in terms of quantitative accuracy but also in terms of clinically equally important further quality metrics such as uncertainty quantification and interpretability. With this resource, we aim to establish the PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG analysis algorithms and encourage other researchers in the field to join these efforts.},

  abstract = {The analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be time consuming as it is performed manually by cardiologists. Therefore, automation through machine learning (ML) classification is being increasingly proposed which would allow ML models to learn the features of a heartbeat and detect abnormalities. The lack of interpretability hinders the application of Deep Learning in healthcare. Through interpretability of these models, we would understand how a machine learning algorithm makes its decisions and what patterns are being followed for classification. This thesis builds Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers based on state-of-the-art models and compares their performance and interpretability to shallow classifiers. Here, both global and local interpretability methods are exploited to understand the interaction between dependent and independent variables across the entire dataset and to examine model decisions in each sample, respectively. Partial Dependence Plots, Shapley Additive Explanations, Permutation Feature Importance, and Gradient Weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-Cam) are the four interpretability techniques implemented on time-series ML models classifying ECG rhythms. In particular, we exploit Grad-Cam, which is a local interpretability technique and examine whether its interpretability varies between correctly and incorrectly classified ECG beats within each class. Furthermore, the classifiers are evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation and Leave Groups Out techniques, and we use non-parametric statistical testing to examine whether differences are significant. It was found that Grad-CAM was the most effective interpretability technique at explaining predictions of proposed CNN and LSTM models. We concluded that all high performing classifiers looked at the QRS complex of the ECG rhythm when making predictions.},

The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.},

  abstract = {Effective detection of arrhythmia is an important task in the remote monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG). The traditional ECG recognition depends on the judgment of the clinicians’ experience, but the results suffer from the probability of human error due to the fatigue. To solve this problem, an ECG signal classification method based on the images is presented to classify ECG signals into normal and abnormal beats by using two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs). First, we compare the accuracy and robustness between one-dimensional ECG signal input method and two-dimensional image input method in AlexNet network. Then, in order to alleviate the overfitting problem in two-dimensional network, we initialize AlexNet-like network with weights trained on ImageNet, to fit the training ECG images and fine-tune the model, and to further improve the accuracy and robustness of ECG classification. The performance evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve the accuracy of 98\% and maintain high accuracy within SNR range from 20 dB to 35 dB. The experiment shows that the 2D-CNNs initialized with AlexNet weights performs better than one-dimensional signal method without a large-scale dataset.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular contractions of the atria. It significantly elevates the risk of strokes due to slowed blood flow in the atria, especially in the left atrial appendage, which is prone to blood clot formation. Such clots can migrate into cerebral arteries, leading to ischemic stroke. To assess whether AF patients should be prescribed anticoagulants, doctors often use the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. However, anticoagulant use must be approached with caution as it can impact clotting functions. This study introduces a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether patients with AF should be recommended anticoagulant therapy using 12-lead ECG data. In this model, we use STOME to enhance time-series data and then process it through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By incorporating a path development layer, the model achieves a specificity of 30.6\% under the condition of an NPV of 1. In contrast, LSTM algorithms without path development yield a specificity of only 2.7\% under the same NPV condition.},
